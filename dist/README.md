# MY WEBSITE!
[The site!](http://danagilliann.me/)

### Cool things to know:
- I built this using Yeoman (ahh good ol' Yeoman)
- The content of the "Projects" is populated through a Tumblr API GET request using AJAX.
- I made it using HTML, CSS, and Javascript (jQuery)
- Deployed using git subtree for [more info](http://stephenplusplus.github.io/yeoman.io/deployment.html)

### You: BUT THIS IS MINIFIED!
I know! That's why there's a separate repo for the full blown code [tun-tun-tunah](https://github.com/danagilliann/website-V2)!
